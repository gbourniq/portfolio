# Ansible documentation

#### Ansible playbooks to test application deployments on fresh EC2 instances 

------------------------------------------

## Usage

### Running the playbooks

The following command run the docker_deployment playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook \
    -i inventories \
    --vault-id user@~/.ssh/ansible-vault-pw \
    docker_deployment.yml \
    -vv
```
Alternatively, a make command can be used from the project root directory:
```bash
cd portfolio/  # if not already at the root of the repository.
make run-ansible-playbook
```

### Encryption of credentials

The `ansible-vault-pw` file mentioned in the command above, contains the `ansible vault passphrase`, which is essentially a string used by Ansible to encrypt and decrypt sensitive variables.

To encrypt a variable, run a command such as:
```bash
ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-id user@~/.ssh/ansible-vault-pw <sensitive-value> --name <var-name>
```
This will output the encrypted variable, which can be inserted in a `<role-name>/vars/main.yaml` to be used within a role.
```

|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`RUN_ANSIBLE_PLAYBOOK`        | Must be set to `True` to run the Ansible playbook within the CD pipeline     |
|`ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD`      | Passphrase used to encrypt/decrypt secret variables (see /ansible/README.md) |

> Note: `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD` and `ANSIBLE_SSH_PASSWORD` must be set on the host (eg. `~/.bash_profile` or Travis CI account settings)


## Project setup

### Ansible inventories

Inventories in ansible are a pattern for grouping managed nodes/hosts. They are located in `ansible/inventories/`.


### Ansible playbooks

Playbooks contain the steps which are set to execute on a particular machine.

This repository contains the following playbooks:

- `docker_deployment.yml`: set up an EC2 instance and deploy portfolio application (`prod` build) using the latest *docker deploy tarball* created from the CD pipeline (step `7_build_and_push_docker_compose_tarball.sh`).

- `kubernetes_deployment.yml`: similar to the above using Helm and Kubernetes (WIP)

- `stop_instance.yml`: stop the EC2 instance whether the above playbooks are successful or not.

### Ansible roles

Roles can be found in `ansible/roles/` and are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure. Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users.

For example, the `docker_deployment.yml` playbook runs the following roles:

- `start_instance`: start an ec2 instance with a given instance-id, and wait for instance to be running

- `setup_instance`: install required packages (pip, awscli, make, ...), and install Docker / docker-compose

- `prepare_deployment`: docker prune all, delete existing project root directory, download the latest docker deployment folder from S3 (built by the CD pipeline), download SSL files for nginx from S3

- `docker_compose_up`: start docker services, wait until services are healthy, and app is running

- `test_postgres_backup`: run postgres back up scripts (dump to S3, and restore from S3)

- `send_slack_notification`: send slack message to notify user the app is up, 

- `pause_playbook`: pause playbook for `<QA_INSTANCE_TIME_MINUTES>` minutes, to give enough time for a user to navigate around the UI and test app functionalities

- `docker_compose_down`: stop and remove docker services


### Testing

> TIP: molecule can be used for testing.
